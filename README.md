# Daily-Task-Planner

## Project Description
Task and time management has always worked best for me when I have a working calendar and I adhere to strict timelines to keep me on schedule. This application is a daily task planner that should help me to stay organized and make sure I am getting things done in a timely manner. The following criteria and functionality are included as follows:

- A header that includes the date and time
- Each hour between 9 am to 5 pm is displayed as a time block, based on a 24 hour clock
- Each hour block will be color-coded and will change based on whether it has passed, is present or is in the future
- Each block will allow text to be entered, creating an event on the planner
- Each event can be saved and entered into local storage
- Upon refreshing, the saved events will remain on the planner
